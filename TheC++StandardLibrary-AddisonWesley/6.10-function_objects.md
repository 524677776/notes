6.10 Funciton Objects

	functional arguments for algorithms don`t have to be functions. as lambdas, functional arguments can be objects that behave like
funcitons. such as functional object, or functor. instead of using a lambda, you can define a function objects as an object of a class
that provides a function call operator. this was possible even before c++11.
