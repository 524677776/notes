6.10.2 predefined function objects

	the c++ standard library contains serveral predefined funciton objects that cover fundamental operations. by using them , you don`t have to write you own function objects in serveral cases. a typical example is a function object used as a sorting criterion. the default sorting criterion for operator < is the predefined sorting criterion less<>, thus , if you declare
		set<int> coll;
	it is expanded to:
		set<int, less<int>>coll; // sort elements with <

	from there, it is easy to sort elements in the opposite order:
		set<int, greater<int>> coll; // sort elements with >

	another place to apply predefined function objects are algorithms:

		deque<int> coll = { 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19};
		transform
		( 
			coll.cbegin(), coll.cend(), // source 
			coll.begin(), 				//destination
			negate<int>();				//operation
		);

		transform
		(
			coll.cbegin(), coll.cend(), //first source 
			coll.cbegin(), 				//second source
			coll.begin(), 				//destination
			multiplies<int>()			//operation
		);
