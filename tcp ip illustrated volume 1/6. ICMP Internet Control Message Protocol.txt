6.1 introduction.
	icmp is considered part of the ip layer.
	it communicates error messages and other conditions that require attention.
	icmp messages are transmitted within ip datagrams.
		ip datagram : ip header(20 bytes) + icmp message.
		
	the format of an icmp message:
		8-bit type + 8-bit code + 16bit checksum
		
6.2 icmp message types.
	query message  
	error message
	
	icmp error message always contains the ip header and the first 8 bytes of the ip datagram that caused the icmp error to be generated.
	
	an icmp error message is never generated in response to :
	1. an icmp error message ( an icmp error message may , however, be generated in response to an icmp query message.)
	2. a datagram destined to an ip broadcast address or an ip multicast address ( a class d address)
	3. a datagram sent as a link-layer broadcast.
	4. a fragment other than the first.
	5. a datagram whose than source address does not define a single host.this means the source address cannot be a zero address, a loopback address, a broadcast address, or a multicast address.
	
6.3 icmp address mask request and reply
	the icmp address mask request is intended for a diskless system to obtain its subnet mask at bootstrap time.
