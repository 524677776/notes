2.1 Introduction.

	purpose:
		send and receive 
		1> ip datagrams for the ip module,
		2> arp requests and replies for the arp module,
		3> rarp requests and replies for the rarp module.
		
	tcp/ip supports many different link layers, depending on the type of networking hardware being used:
	ethernet, token ring, fddi(fiber distributed data interface), rs-232 serial lines, and the like.
	
	Ethernet link layer,
	SLIP : serial line ip
	PPP : point-to-point protocol
	loopback driver 
	MTU(maximum transmission unit)
	
	
2.2 Ethernet and IEEE 802 Encapsulation

	ethernet is the predominant form of local area network technology used with tcp/ip.
	ethernet uses an access method called CSMA/CD( carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection).
	ethernet opeates at 10Mbits/sec and uses 48-bit addresses.
	
	IEEE: institure of electrical and electronics engineers
	802.3 covers an entire set of CSMA/CD networks.
	802.4 covers token bus networks
	802.5 covers token ring networks.
	802.2 standard common to all three of these
	
	in the tcp/ip world, the encapsulation of ip datagrams is defined in RFC 894 for ethernets and in RFC 1042 for IEEE 802 networks.
	
	the host requirements RFC requires that every Internet host connect to a 10 Mbits/sec ethernet cable:
	1. must be able to send and receive packets using RFC 894 encapsulation.
	2. should be able to receive RFC 1042 packets intermixed with RFC 894 packets.
	3. may be able to send packets using RFC 1042 encapsulation. if the host can send both types of packets, the type of packet send must be configurable and the configuration option must default to RFC 894 packets.
	
	hardware addresses : both frame formats use 48-bit(6 byte) destination and source addresses.
