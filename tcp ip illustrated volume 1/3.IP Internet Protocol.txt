3.1 Introduction.

	all TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IGMP data gets transmitted as IP datagrams.
	IP provides an unreliable, connectionless datagram delivery service.
	
	1. by unreliable we mean there are no guarantees that an IP datagram successfully gets to its destination.
	IP has a simple error handling algorithm: throw away the datagram and try to send an ICMP message back to the source.
	any required reliability must be provided by the upper layers.
	
	2. the term connectionless means that IP does not maintain any state information about successive datagrams.
	each datagram is handled independently from all other datagrams.
	it can get delivery out of order.

3.2 IP header.
	
	the normal size of the IP header is 20 bytes, unless options are present. 20*8= 160 bits.
	
	the 4 bytes in the 32-bit value are transmitted in the order:
	
	4 bytes = 8 bits.
	
	00 - 07 
	08 - 15
    16 - 23
    23 - 26
    26 - 31
	
	bits 0-7 first, then 8-15, then 16-23, and bits 24-31 last.
	this is called big endian byte ordering, which is the byte ordering required for all binary integers in the TCP/IP headers as they traverse a network. this is called the network byte order.

	e.g 90AB12CD
	
	big endian: store the most significant byte in the smallest address.
	1000 90
	1001 AB
	1002 12
	1003 CD
	
	little endian: you store the least significant byte in the smallest address.
	1000 CD
	1001 12
	1002 AB
	1003 90
	
	little endian must convert the header values into the network byte order before transmitting the data.
	
	the hader length is the number of 32-bit words in the header, including any options.
	since this is a 4-bit field, it limits the header to 60 bytes. the normal value of this field is 5.
	
	the type-of-service field (TOS) is composed of a 3-bit precedence field
